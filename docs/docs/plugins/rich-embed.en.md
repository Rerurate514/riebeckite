# Rich Embed

Displays external links as richer embeds rather than plain links.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @riebeckite/plugin-rich-embed
```

Check the implementation and package README as the source of truth for the Plugin's export names and configuration options. Riebeckite Plugins are registered in the `plugins` array of `riebeckite.config.ts`.

## Example

Use it when external pages should appear as cards or embeds with information such as a title and summary.

```markdown
https://example.com/article
```

## When to use it

Add this Plugin only when you need its functionality. If it is already included by your Preset, you do not need to register the same Plugin again.

When a rendered example is available, you can also see it in the [Plugin Showcase](./showcase.en.md).

## Detailed specification

For configuration options, public APIs, constraints, and additional examples, see the package README. For the overall Plugin architecture, see [Plugin System](../framework/plugin-system.en.md). To create a Plugin, see [Writing a Plugin](./writing-a-plugin.en.md).
